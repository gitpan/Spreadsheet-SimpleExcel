Spreadsheet-SimpleExcel version 0.1
====================================

This module is used to show data in excel-files in the web. It can be used
to provide the results of a database query as an excel-file. It does not provide
cell-formats yet, but the module will be extended within the next weeks.

Spreadsheet::SimpleExcel was created under working title "WWW::WebExcel"

This version provides 10 methods:
 * new                 creates a new instance of SimpleExcel
 * add_row             appends new rows to the existing ones
 * set_headers         replaces the existing list of headers
 * add_row_at          inserts a row into existing data
 * sort_data           sorts the data
 * output              prints data as spreadsheet
 * output_as_string    returns the output as a string
 * output_to_file      prints data into a file
 * add_worksheet       adds a worksheet to the spreadsheet
 * del_worksheet       deletes a worksheet of the spreadsheet
 * errstr              returns the error message of last occured error
 * sort_worksheets     sort worksheets in asc or desc order

As a simple example:

	binmode(\*STDOUT);
	my @data;
	$sth->execute() or die $DBI::errstr;
	while(my @row = $sth->fetchrow_array()){
	  push(@data,\@row);
	}
	my $worksheet = ['NAME',{-data => \@data}]
	my $excel = Spreadsheet::SimpleExcel->new(-worksheets => [$worksheet]);
	$excel->output();
